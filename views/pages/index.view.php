<!-- 
The home page will be used to search for listings in the database

Display a drop-down menu for all states in the database, followed by check-in and check-out date inputs.
The dates must follow these rules:
 1. The check-in date cannot be earlier than the current date.
 2. The check-out date cannot be before or the same as the check-in date.

Add a "Search" button to submit your query that will take you to the "results.php" page.
